# DevOps Project

## Overview
This project uses Git for version control. It follows Git best practices and a GitHub-based workflow.

## Branching Strategy
- `main`: For stable production-ready code.
- `dev`: Development branch.
- `feature`: For new features under development.

## Workflow
1. Create feature branches off `dev`.
2. Open a pull request to merge feature into `dev`.
3. Merge pull requests and keep `dev` up to date.
4. Tag releases as `v1.0`, `v1.1`, etc.
